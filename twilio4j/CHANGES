VERSION 0.9.4 - 2011083001
==========================

  - Added twiML 'Client' noun to the Dial verb to support the new Twilio Client.
  - Made a cosmetic change to a variable name in 'Record' to match wording in docs.


VERSION 0.9.3 - 2011040101
==========================

Fixed some usability issues:
  - getInitialState() now takes the TwilioParameters so that it can optionally
    behave as a dispatcher to multiple state machines.
  - Added a DeclarativeComposer class so that you can write stand-alone state
    machines that do not inherit from HttpServlet. In this way you can setup
    a dispatcher to return the initial state of a particular state machine.
    (I need to write up an example.)
  - nested verbs are now implemented as array lists so that they may be appended
    to, allowing dynamic TwiML creation, and not just static declarative TwiML
    creation.
  - fixed missing method from the Twilio API -- Conference.waitUrl() can also
    take a string arg now, specifying a single music resource directly.


VERSION 0.9.2 - 2011032801
==========================

Fixed missing parameter getters if the incoming request is from an SMS message.
  - added getSmsSid() to TwilioParameters class
  - added getBody() to TwilioParameters class


VERSION 0.9.1 - 2011032201
==========================

Nearing first release of a jar file. Much refactoring and javadocs done.
Some real live testing remains.
