= Thoughts about a version 2.0 of Twilio4j =

I am thinking about a different approach for defining handlers for each state of the state machine. It would be preferable to simply annotate a method with some kind of `@TwilioHandler` annotation and specify which state it is meant to handle. This would be slightly less awkward than calling handler() several times in a constructor.

I am also thinking about using Jersey to accomplish this, since it already has much of this legwork done. This includes having some custom injection, so we could pass a arguments things like:

{{{
  public void handleThing(@Context GatherParams params) {
    // code here
  }
}}}

Jersey 2.0 cleans up their built-in dependency injection, so perhaps we shall wait until it is available.
