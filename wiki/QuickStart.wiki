= Introduction =

Twilio4j consists of a servlet that will drive a state machine. You supply the state machine by extending the TwilioStateMachine class (which itself is a ultimately a subclass of HttpServlet). In order to create your subclass, you first need to create an Enum that enumerates all the possible states of your state machine.

You will also add an entry to your web.xml file to map a servletPath to your new state machine class.

Example:
{{{
public enum NumberGameState {
	PICK_NUMBER,
	CHECK_NUMBER,
}
}}}
