[http://www.gentomi.com/twilio4j/TwilioCallFlowStateMachine.svg]

The key points are:
  * you define your states as an Enum in java.
  * you extend the TwilioStateMachine class.
  * in your subclass, write blocks of action code for each enum'd state.
  * actions can be TwiML, or Java code.
  * where TwiML expects a URL for next action, just pass a enum'd state.
  * TwiML is expressed in pure type-safe Java.
